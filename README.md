# Imagine
Imagine is a website that allow you to you use your imagination in drawing. There are loads of useful tools that can be used for realizing ur plans. 
There are some types of drawing buttons that have different thickness (pencil, brush, marker and fill). Only brush has interesting (unworking now) function as changing the thickness by buttons (1-9). Also there are two types of Eraser buttons (Eraser, Clear-All), System Buttons (Checkerboard (unworked now), Fill 2.0, Download, Blackboard), Color Buttons (Custom color button unworked) and shape buttons (all are unworked). So it's a chance to open your drawing talents and just enjoy drawing. My repository is free for contributing. :D
